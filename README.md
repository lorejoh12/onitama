Onitama Javascript engine

This is a javascript implementation of the board game Onitama. I followed along with Bluefever's "Programming A Chess Engine In Pure Javascript" Youtube code tutorial, making changes as necessary for adapting Onitama's different movement rules.

This was intended as a learning project, mostly for the AI aspect of of the computer player, and the UI aspect of the pure javascript.
